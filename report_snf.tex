\section{Summary of the research work and its results}

In this project we have focused on a series of diverse aspects of multiscale differential problems \cite{BLP78,CiD99} and their numerical solution \cite{AEE12}. Multiscale differential equations arise in a wide range of models and find applications in both applied and social sciences. Often, the discretization needed for solving multiscale equations numerically is constrained by the characteristic length of the smallest size in the problem. For this reason, we employ the theory of homogenization, which allows to obtain effective models which give a macroscopic description of the multiscale solution, and in practice to solve numerically the equations. The multiplicity of scales in the problem could be spatial, e.g. in elasticity or heat transfer problems for heterogeneous materials, or temporal, e.g. in modelling chemical reactions with a fast/slow behaviour or in modelling financial markets with a micro/macro structure.

The content of this project can be roughly divided in two parts. The first concerns the numerical solution of multiscale \textit{forward} problems, and is summarized in \cref{sec:Edoardo,sec:Rosilho_1,sec:Rosilho_2}. In this part, we consider the data of the problem (i.e., elasticity of a heterogeneous material, volatility of a financial market, ...) to be given, and design novel analytical and numerical techniques for approximate the solution of the underlying differential equations. In the second part, which is summarized in \cref{sec:AndreaDB,sec:AndreaZ} we instead consider multiscale \textit{inverse} problems, for which the data is the unknown, and a solution is given as observations. The more fundamental topic of \textit{probabilistic numerical methods}, which can be employed to milden some issues in both the forward and the inverse solutions, is finally summarized in \cref{sec:Giacomo}.

\subsection{Corrector problems with enhanced resonance errors in the FE-HMM}\label{sec:Edoardo}

The finite element heterogeneous multiscale method (FE-HMM) \cite{Abd05b,EE03} is a numerical scheme designed for partial differential equations (PDEs) with highly-oscillatory coefficients. In this setting, a fine mesh is needed to approximate the solution with a standard finite element solver. Indeed, the mesh characteristic size cannot exceed the oscillation size if the goal is capturing the microscopic features of the solution. If we are only interested in the macroscopic behaviour, we can instead rely on to the theory of homogenization \cite{BLP78,CiD99} and first compute an effective, or \textit{homogenized}, non-oscillatory coefficient, and then solve numerically the corresponding homogenized PDE on a coarse mesh. The two-step procedure described above is, in extreme synthesis, the FE-HMM. The computation of the homogenized coefficient is not trivial, and involves the solution of auxiliary elliptic PDEs, the \textit{corrector equations} (also \textit{cell problems}), on microscopic domains centred at the quadrature points of the macroscopic mesh. In the non-periodic case, there are no closed-form formulas for setting the boundary conditions of the cell problems, as well as the size of the micro domains, which have to be chosen artificially. The resulting mismatch results in the so-called \textit{resonance errors}, which can be dominating in some specific scenarios with respect to numerical and modelling errors. Existing approaches for reducing the resonance error rely on oversampling \cite{YuE07}, on filtering the corrector problems \cite{BlL10}, or on Richardson-extrapolation-type approaches \cite{GlH16}.
 
In this project, we designed two novel corrector problems for determining the homogenized coefficient in the framework of multiscale elliptic PDEs. The first approach consists in solving a parabolic, instead of elliptic, cell problem, and then filtering the resulting correctors with appropriate filtering kernels. A rigorous set-up and analysis of our methodology allowed us to conclude that the resonance error converges in this case with a arbitrarily high order with respect to the size of the micro domains. Fast convergence is achieved through high order filtering kernels, and a trade-off between high order (asymptotic) and computational cost (pre-asymptotic) is demonstrated via thoroughly-designed numerical experiments. We present our results on parabolic corrector problems in the peer-reviewed articles \cite{AAP19,AAP21}. The second methodology is derived from the parabolic approach by considering \textit{modified} elliptic correctors. Indeed, we consider the traditional corrector problems, and modify their right-hand side by introducing time averages of the solution of our parabolic corrector problems. We describe how to perform the computation of these time averages efficiently by means of appropriate Krylov subspace methods. Again, we rigorously show that our methodology based on modified elliptic problems can be set up to show arbitrarily high order convergence, and demonstrate the accuracy and performances with a series of numerical experiments. Our theoretical and numerical results are published in the peer-reviewed article \cite{AAP19}, and in the research article \cite{AAP20}, currently available as a preprint and submitted for publication. Finally, we adapted the computation of our modified cell problems to a challenging setting of elliptic PDEs with random multiscale coefficients. In this setting, we were able to prove convergence for good proportions of the solution variance, and deduce numerically a conjecture for the unexplained variability. Our results on the stochastic scenario are presented in the research article \cite{AAP20b}, currently available as a preprint and submitted for publication.
